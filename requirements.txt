A way to send notifications to friends that are not intrusive
A notification consists of:
    - Who sent it
    - Where the flare is "over" (the location of the pub)
    - When it was sent
    - When the flare expires (constant? user-definable?)
A way for friends to specify when they see notifications in order to be unobtrusive
    - Be able to specify the means of push notifications, e.g. app push, SMS, email, etc.? (MVP: app notifications)
    - Be able to specify times when they receive push notifications
    - Be able to specify location boundaries when they should receive notifications
        - inside and/or outside a particular area
        - within a certain radius of me (default? suggestion?)
Needs to take privacy into consideration (locations are involved)
Advertising is allowed, but can be opted out
    - Small banner ads at bottom of app pages (never pop-up)
    - Targeted ads opt-in - never receive app information
Needs to work in Docker
    - learning opportunity
Needs to be deployed to AWS
    - learning opportunities

Use Cases:
Flare Poppers
    - users of the application
    - want to go to the pub
    - want to hang out with friends
    - want to let friends know where they're hanging out
    - future or present?

Friends
    - users of the application
    - want to see flares from their friends on their terms
    - want to define those terms
    - let friend (flare popper) know they're coming?
